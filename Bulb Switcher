319. Bulb Switcher My Submissions Question
Total Accepted: 2482 Total Submissions: 6777 Difficulty: Medium
There are n bulbs that are initially off. You first turn on all the bulbs. Then, you turn off every second bulb. On the third round, you toggle every third bulb (turning on if it's off or turning off if it's on). For the nth round, you only toggle the last bulb. Find how many bulbs are on after n rounds.

Example:

Given n = 3. 

At first, the three bulbs are [off, off, off].
After first round, the three bulbs are [on, on, on].
After second round, the three bulbs are [on, off, on].
After third round, the three bulbs are [on, off, off]. 

So you should return 1, because there is only one bulb is on.

public class Solution {
    public int bulbSwitch(int n) {
        /*  For prime numbers, they must be off because we can reach them only twice (The first round 
            and their own round).
         For other numbers, if we can reach them odd times, then they are on; otherwise, they are off. 
             So only 
         those numbers who have square root will be reached odd times and there are sqrt(n) of them 
             because
         for every x > sqrt(n), x*x > n and thus should not be considered as the answer. */
         return (int)Math.sqrt(n);
    }
